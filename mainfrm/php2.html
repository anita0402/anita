 <form name="form1" action="html_form_action.asp" method="post">
Username: <input type="text" name="textvar1">

<input type="hidden" name="hiddenvar" value="">

<input type="button" value="Submit" onclick='JSFUNC(this.form, form2.form)>
</form>

<form name="form2" action="html_form_action2.asp" method="post">
Username: <input type="text" name="textvar2">
<input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

What I'd like to do is be able to click a button that will take form2's textvar2 element as a parameter then submit form1 with element hiddenvar with a value of the form2 element textvar2.

Just for testing I have this as my javascript:

function JSFUNC(form1, form2)
{
var Item = form2.textvar2.value;

alert(Item);
form1.submit();

}

This doesn't work, the JS chokes on trying to set var Item.  I've tried a bunch of variations and sometimes get the alert to spit out "undefined".  It seems the main problem is passing in the form2 parameter.  Would it be better to get the form2 element value and pass that as a parameter instead?

Am I going about this completely the wrong way?

As always, thanks!

I think Item is looking for an id, not a name, maybe try this

Username: <input type="text" name="textvar2" id="textvar2">

Also you may want to add document. to your form reference. Or maybe reference the element using GetElementById...

Change JSFUNC(this.form, form2.form) to JSFUNC(this.form, document.form2). It worked for me.

Thanks for that Bill.

For whatever reason my trouble seemed to stem from trying to pass a second form object as a parameter.  I finally got what I needed by passing in document.formname.elementname.value as the second parameter for the JS function.

Might be better to reference by id however I'm just trying to temporary fix something that will be replaced a few months down the road so quick and dirty works.

This was time sensitive so really appreciate the quick response and help.
