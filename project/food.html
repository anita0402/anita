	<div class="col-md-12"><h2> Top Most Antioxidant Rich Foods </h2><div class="col-md-8"><p>Antioxidants are compounds in foods that stop or delay the damage to the cells. They are naturally found in many foods, especially plants. Antioxidants fight off cell damage by cleaning up or removing waste products (free radicals) in the cells before they can do harm. They are released from the foods we eat and travel through the bloodstream into cells. Free radical is a general term used for compounds that are highly reactive, which means that they can attach, bind to, and ultimately damage normal cells in the body. The body has a built-in defense mechanism to reduce the impact of free radicals but it could use some help. That is where antioxidants come in to bind the free radicals, thereby potentially reducing harm to your cells. Antioxidants work to guard the cells against damage caused by oxidants. Oxidants are free radicals that the body produces to defend itself against bacteria and viruses. Too many oxidants start attacking and harming the cells may put you...</p></div><div class="col-md-4"><img src="img/ultimate-guide-antioxidants-fb.jpg" /></div></div>

But a recent study has proven that cashews may help to improve cholesterol levels and lower blood pressure.Dr V. Mohan of Madras Diabetes Research Foundation (Chennai), the lead author of the study, claimed that 20% of the fat in cashew nuts is of the saturated variety but this didn’t have any negative impact on the cholesterol levels. The evidence is based on a study of 300 people in Chennai with type-2 diabetes. All the subjects followed a standard diabetic diet. Half of them were asked to consume 30 grams of unsalted, raw, cashews every day for about 90 days. At the end of the study, their blood pressure levels reduced, and high-density lipoprotein (good cholesterol) had increased in the partakers compared to the non-cashew group.
